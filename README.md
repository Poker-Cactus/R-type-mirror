> **A Multi-threaded Game Engine implementation of the legendary 90's Shoot'em'up.**

This project is a networked video game engine developed in C++, designed to recreate the experience of the classic **R-Type**. It features a custom Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture, allowing multiple players to join forces over a network against the Bydo Empire.

## 📖 The Lore

**Blast off against the Bydo Empire!**

R-Type is a classic **Horizontal Shoot'em'up** (Shmup) that defined the genre in the 90s. Set in deep space, humanity is threatened by the evil **Bydos**, a biomechanical alien race bent on destruction.

In this reimagined version, you pilot the R-9 Arrowhead spaceship. Your mission is simple but deadly:

1. Navigate through the scrolling star-fields of space.
2. Survive waves of Bydo slaves and dodge enemy missiles.
3. Confront massive Bosses (like the terrifying Dobkeratops).
4. Utilize your **Force** attachment to shield yourself or unleash devastating attacks.

Unlike the original solo experience, our engine supports **Networked Multiplayer**, allowing a squadron of players to fight the alien threat together.

### Visual Elements

As per the classic design, our engine handles various entities simultaneously:

- **Player Ships:** Distinctly identifiable for each networked player.
- **Monsters:** Basic enemies and Bydo slaves with unique patterns.
- **Powerups:** Drop from specific enemies to upgrade weapons.
- **Projectiles:** Both enemy and player missiles.
- **Environment:** Destroyable tiles and stage obstacles.
- **Background:** Parallax scrolling star-field.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Linux/macOS
### Prerequisites

- **OS:** Linux (Required), Windows (Supported)
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Dependency Manager:** Conan

### Installation

```bash
# Install Git hooks (format code automatically on commit)
./scripts/install-hooks.sh

# Build the project
./build.sh

# Or manually via CMake/Conan:
conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing --profile=conan_profile
cmake --preset conan-release
cmake --build build --config Release
```

---

## Usage

Run the server first, then connect with one or more clients.

```bash
# Terminal 1: Launch the Authoritative Server
./build/server/r-type_server

# Terminal 2+: Launch the Graphical Client
./build/client/r-type_client
```

### Windows (MSVC)

```powershell
# Install dependencies with Conan
python -m conans.conan install . --output-folder=build --build=missing -s build_type=Release

# Configure with CMake (uses Visual Studio generator by default)
cmake --preset conan-default

# Build
cmake --build build --config Release

# Copy required DLL next to client executable
Copy-Item -Path "build\libs\Release\sdl2_module.dll" -Destination "build\client\Release\" -Force

# Run (from project root)
.\build\server\Release\server.exe
.\build\client\Release\client.exe
```
